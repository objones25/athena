# Athena - An Intelligent STEM Knowledge Assistant

Athena is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system specializing in programming, algorithms, and mathematics. Built in Go, it combines multiple knowledge sources with advanced language models to provide accurate, well-referenced responses for technical queries.

## Core Philosophy

Athena approaches technical assistance with three fundamental principles:

1. Accuracy and Verifiability: Every response is grounded in reliable sources with clear citations. When uncertainty exists, Athena explicitly communicates it and explains its reasoning process.

2. Deep Technical Understanding: Specializing in Go, Python, and mathematics, Athena understands not just the syntax but the underlying concepts, enabling it to provide meaningful explanations rather than just code snippets.

3. Clear Communication: Complex technical concepts are broken down into understandable components, with step-by-step reasoning and relevant examples.

## Features

### Current Implementation (Phase 1)
- Natural language understanding optimized for technical queries
- Multi-turn conversations with context preservation
- Integration with key knowledge sources:
  - GitHub API for code examples and patterns
  - Stack Exchange API for technical solutions
  - arXiv API for academic papers
  - Wolfram Alpha API for mathematical computations
- Hybrid embedding system specialized for different content types
- Comprehensive source citation and reference tracking
- Efficient caching with Redis
- Vector search using Milvus

### Planned Features (Phase 2)
- Interactive debugging capabilities
- Code completion suggestions
- Mathematical visualization and LaTeX rendering
- Enhanced proof verification system
- Continuous knowledge base updates

## System Architecture

### Knowledge Integration
Athena employs a tiered approach to knowledge retrieval:

1. Primary Sources:
   - GitHub: Real-world code examples and programming patterns
   - Stack Exchange: Community-vetted solutions and explanations
   - arXiv: Academic papers in mathematics and computer science
   - Wolfram Alpha: Mathematical computations and verifications

2. Caching Strategy:
   - In-memory cache for frequent queries
   - Redis for medium-term storage
   - Milvus for vector storage and semantic search

3. Embedding System:
   - CodeBERT: Optimized for programming content
   - SentenceBERT: Specialized for mathematical text
   - Standard BERT: General technical content

### Resource Management

The system is designed to operate within reasonable cost constraints:
- API Usage: Primarily utilizing free tiers with intelligent rate limiting
- Storage: Efficient caching to minimize redundant API calls
- Compute: Optional local embedding for cost optimization

Estimated monthly resource usage for personal use:
- Storage: 20-50GB (documents, embeddings, cache)
- API Calls: Within free tiers for most services
- Estimated Monthly Cost: $20-50 (primarily LLM API usage)

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- Memory: 2-4GB RAM recommended
- Storage: 20-50GB for document cache
- CPU: 4+ cores recommended
- GPU: Optional, improves embedding generation

### Optimization Strategies
- Batch processing for API calls
- Intelligent caching based on usage patterns
